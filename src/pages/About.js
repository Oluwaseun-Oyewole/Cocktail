				When you have a great story about how your product
				or service was built to change lives, share it. The
				"About Us" page is a great place for it to live,
				too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing
				context and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more,
				good stories are sticky -- which means people are
				more likely to connect with them and pass them on.
